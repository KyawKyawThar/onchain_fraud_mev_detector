//! The shared Kafka-backbone seam (§20) — the one place every service's produce
//! *and* consume policy lives, so neither can drift per-service.
//!
//! **Produce.** [`EventSink`] is the object-safe seam each producer's logic writes
//! against, so the interesting parts (the ingestion reorg walk, the detection
//! fan-out) can be unit-tested against an in-memory sink with no broker.
//! [`KafkaEventSink`] is the production impl: it routes each envelope to its
//! schema-derived topic ([`EventEnvelope::topic`]), keys it via
//! [`EventEnvelope::partition_key`] (by chain for per-chain order, §20 — but the
//! simulation result path by its incident business key so it dedups per incident,
//! §7), and injects the current W3C trace context into the record headers so a
//! downstream consumer continues the same distributed trace across the broker
//! (§19). Delivery is at-least-once: [`publish_resilient`] retries a transient
//! broker blip until it succeeds or shutdown, and only gives up on a permanent
//! (encode) failure that can never succeed.
//!
//! **Consume.** [`run_consumer`] is the symmetric half: the resilient at-least-once
//! consume loop every simple stream consumer (the simulation dispatcher, the reorg
//! consumer, the event-store ingest) was hand-rolling — subscribe, shutdown-aware
//! receive, decode-or-skip-poison, trace-span continuation, and commit-vs-retry —
//! now in one tested place. A service supplies only its per-record decision as an
//! [`EventHandler`] returning a [`Handled`] verdict; the loop owns everything else.
//! (Detection's consumer is deliberately *not* built on this — it decodes to a
//! domain command, hands off to a bounded channel, and commits in a separate stage
//! to preserve per-chain ordering, a genuinely different shape.)
